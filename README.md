##  Smart Contract Address -: KT1PXzN83VLpHZUJ9G9Apr2461PkvTZY5nHe

## 📄 Abstract
Blockchain has the ability to keep an incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent log of all FIR data makes it a technology rife for security applications. Additionally, while blockchain is transparent it is also private, concealing the identity of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of Fir data. The decentralized nature of the technology also allows Police Administration and people to share the same information quickly and safely.

## 🗒️ Introduction
This project effectively stores the FIR data on the blockchain network nowadays we see many police personnel doing some fraud with the databases containing FIR's and manipulating it for their own good and sometimes the FIR reports are even modified when someone gives bribes to the Police staff so that they can modify the previously existing data so to keep all the data secure and transparent we have created a whole Fir lodging management system on the blockchain network where it can be kept safe and it cannot be manipulated.

### 📚 Tech stack
- SmartPy(For Smart Contracts)
- TempleWallet(For the smart Contract Transactions)
- Taquito
- React JS

### ⚙ Working
This app will first take input from the Police or person lodging FIR regarding all the data of the case. Once the data is saved and stored on the blockchain network no one can modify that data since it is on the blockchain network.

🔖How to run this application on your system?
 
📍 In order to use the Tezos smart contracts your browser must support cryptographically supported Wallets. <br>
📍 For this project u can use Tezos Temple Wallet(). <br>
📍 Your Wallet must have some free ithacanet Test net Tokens. <br>
📍 After Your Wallet is configured kindly fill the all the necessary details and then click on submit Button.<br>
📍 When u click on submit button it will directly open your Tezos Wallet and will ask you to connect the wallet and then once you connect the wallet with application you need to sign that transaction. <br>
📍 Whoooo!! Your Lyrics are successfully saved on the Blockchain to verify that(For Dev purpose only) you can go to Better call dev and enter the contract address and see all the recent transactions. <br>

### Video Demonstration:

### 🔑 KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network.
- Once the Medical Records are inserted then no one can modify them.
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network

### 🌈 CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of Unfairness which sometimes Hospital Management staff does in order to manipulate the data.

### FUTURE PROSPECT
- To make our system more useful and convinient, we plan on adding whole management data inside this blockchain Network.
